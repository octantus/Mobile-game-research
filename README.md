# Mobile-game-research
A series of tasks to research several aspects of a mobile application.
Tasks:
- A function was written to calculate Retention.
- In addition, the company conducted A/B testing of sets of promotional offers. Based on the available data, we determine which set can be considered the best and based on what metrics it is worth making the right decision.
- I offer metrics for assessing the results of the last thematic event in the game.
